<p>A collection of pandoc filters that I have made. They are written in lua, <a href="https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html">which makes them faster than filters written in any other language</a>. Copy them into <code>$HOME/.pandoc/filters</code>. Use them with <code>--lua-filter</code>.</p>

<pre class="python" data-include="/path/to/file.py"><code>whatever is in here will get replaced</code></pre></li>
