<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Lectus vestibulum mattis ullamcorper velit sed. Sagittis vi. Here is <strong>test 1 of <code>code-includes</code></strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">// A test file to be included in 
fn fib(n: u32) -&gt; u32 {
    match n {
        0 =&gt; 1,
        1 =&gt; 1,
        _ =&gt; fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2),
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. Here is <strong>test 2 of <code>code-includes</code></strong>:</p>
<pre class="memes others"><code class="language-rust">// A test file to be included in

<p>Here is <strong>Test 3 of <code>code-includes</code></strong>:</p>
<pre id="file"><code>yes

<h3 id="here-is-the-content-from-file-beta">Here is the content from file <code>beta</code>:</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Beta</dt>
<dd>(computing) The phase of development after alpha testing and before launch, in which software, while not complete, has been released to potential users for testing.

</dl>
<p>He quickly deduced our goal – ship a quality beta – but he also quickly discerned that we had no idea about the quality of the product because of our pile of untriaged bugs.</p>
<h3 id="here-is-the-content-from-file-gamma">Here is the content from file <code>gamma</code>:</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Gamma</dt>
<dd>a penetrating <em>electromagnetic</em> radiation arising from the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Gamma rays are ionizing radiation and are thus biologically hazardous. Due to their high penetration power, they can damage bone marrow and internal organs.</p>
<h3 id="here-is-the-content-from-file-the-delta">Here is the content from file <code>the delta</code>:</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Delta</dt>
<dd>A river delta is a landform that forms from deposition of sediment
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A river delta is formed at the mouth of a river where the river deposits the sediment load carried by it and drains into a slower moving or static body of water.</p>
<p>Let’s also see if <code>code-includes</code> still works in the 3rd level of including:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">// A test file to be included in 
fn fib(n: u32) -&gt; u32 {
    match n {
        0 =&gt; 1,

        _ =&gt; fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2),
    }
}</code></pre>
