## For `code-includes`

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Lectus vestibulum
mattis ullamcorper velit sed. Sagittis vi. Here is **test 1 of
`code-includes`**:

``` {.rust inc=""}
// A test file to be included in 
fn fib(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 1,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2),
    }
}
```

But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. Here is
**test 2 of `code-includes`**:

``` {.rust .memes .others inc="no"}
// A test file to be included in 
fn fib(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 1,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2),
    }
}
```

Here is **Test 3 of `code-includes`**:

``` {#file}
yes
// This should be kept
>>>
please don't fold it
nope.
```

## For `transclude`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Here is the content from file `beta`:

Beta
:   (computing) The phase of development after alpha testing and before
    launch, in which software, while not complete, has been released to
    potential users for testing.

He quickly deduced our goal -- ship a quality beta -- but he also
quickly discerned that we had no idea about the quality of the product
because of our pile of untriaged bugs.

### Here is the content from file `gamma`:

Gamma
:   a penetrating *electromagnetic* radiation arising from the
    radioactive decay of atomic nuclei.

Gamma rays are ionizing radiation and are thus biologically hazardous.
Due to their high penetration power, they can damage bone marrow and
internal organs.

### Here is the content from file `the delta`:

Delta
:   A river delta is a landform that forms from deposition of sediment

A river delta is formed at the mouth of a river where the river deposits
the sediment load carried by it and drains into a slower moving or
static body of water.

Let's also see if `code-includes` still works in the 3rd level of
including:

``` {.rust inc="y"}
// A test file to be included in 
fn fib(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 1,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2),
    }
}
```

## For `standard-code`

``` {.python}
some_python = " "
some_python > 0
```

``` {.notreallang}
fun main() {
    Sys.Out.Println("Hello World!");
}
```
